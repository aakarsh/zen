    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Prologue: Beginner's Mind</h3>
    <div class="chapter-body">
    <p>
        People say that practicing Zen is difficult, but there is a misunderstanding as to why.
        It is not difficult because it is hard to sit in the cross-legged position, or to attain
        enlightenment. It is difficult because it is hard to keep our mind pure or our practice 
        pure in its fundamental sense. The Zen school developed in many ways after it was established
        in China, but at the same time, it became more and more impure. But I do not want to talk 
        about Chinese Zen or the history of Zen. I am interested in helping you keep your 
        practice from becoming impure. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In Japan we have a phrase <i>shoshin</i> which means "beginner's mind". the goal of practice
        is always to keep our beginner's mind. Suppose you recite the Prajna Paramita Sutra only 
        once. It might be a very good recitation. But what would happen to you if you recited it twice,
        three times, four times, or more? You might easily lose your original attitude towards it. The 
        same thing will happen in your own Zen practices. For a while you will keep your beginner's mind, 
        but if you continue to practice on, two, three years or more, although you may improve some, you 
        are liable to lose the limitless meaning of original mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Zen students the most important thing is not to be dualistic. Our "original mind" include 
        everything within itself. it is always rich and sufficient within itself. You should not lose your
        self-sufficient state of mind. This does not mean a closed mind, but actually an empty mind and a
        ready mind. If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the
        beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you discriminate too much, you limit yourself. If you are too demanding or too greedy, 
        your mind is not rich and self-sufficient. If we lose our original self-sufficient mind, we 
        will lose all precepts. when your mind becomes demanding, when you long for something, you 
        will end up violating your own precepts: not to tell lies, not to stea, not to kill, not to be 
        immoral, and so forth. If you keep your original mind, the precepts will keep themselves. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the beginner's mind there is no thought, "I have attained somehting." all self-centered 
        thoughts limit our vast mind. when we have no thought of acheivement, no thought of self, we are 
        true beginners. then we can really learn somehting. the beginner's  mind is the mind of 
        compassion. when our mind is compassionate, it is boundless. dogen-zenji, the founder of our 
        school, always emphasized how importat it is to resume our boundless
        original mind. then we are always true to ourselves, in sympathy with all beings, and 
        can acutally practice. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So the most difficult thing is to keep your beginner's mind. There is no need to have a deep 
        understanding of Zen.  Even though you read much Zen literature, you must read each sentence 
        with a fresh mind. You should not say, "I know what Zen is", or "I have attained enlightenment." 
        This is also the real secret of the arts: always be a beginner. Be very very careful 
        about this point. If you start to practice zazen, you will begin to appreciate your
        beginner's mind. It is the secret of Zen practice.

    <h3 class="chapter-title"> Right Practice</h3>

    <h4 class="chapter-tagline"> <span class="first-word">Posture</span> "These forms are not the 
        means of obtaining the right state of mind.  To take this posture is itself to have the 
        right state of mind. There is no need to obtain some speacial state of mind" </h4>

    <div class="chapter-body">
    <p >
    Now I would like to talk about zazen posture. When you sit in the full lotus position, your left foot
    is on your right thigh, and your right foot is on your left thigh. When we cross our legs like this, 
    even though we have a right leg and a left leg, they have become one. The position expresses the oneness
    of duality: not two, and not one. Our body and mind are are not two and not one. If you think your body
    and mind are two, that is wrong; If you think your body and mind are two, that is also wrong. Our body 
    and mind are both two and one. We usually think that if something is not one, it is more than one; if 
    it is not singular, it is plural. But in actual experience, our life is not only plural, but also 
    singular. Each one of us is both dependent and independent. 
    </p>
    <p>
    After some years we will die. If we think that this is the end of our live, this will be the wrong
    understanding. But, on the other hand, if we think that we do not die, this is also wrong. We die, 
    and we do not die. That is the right understaning. Some people may say that our mind or soul exists
    forever, and it is only our physical body which dies. But this is not exactly right, because both 
    mind and body have their end. But at the same time it is also true that they exist eternally. And 
    even though we say mind and body, they are actually two sides of one coin. That is the right 
    understanding. Some people may say that our mind or soul exits forever, and it is only our physical
    body which dies. But this is not exactly right, because both mind and body have their end. But 
    at the same time it is also true that they exist eternally. And even though we say mind and body, they 
    are actually two sides of one coin. This is the right understanding. So when we take this posture it 
    symbolizes this truth. When I have the left foot on the right side of my body, and the right foot
    on the left side of my body, I do not know which is which. So either may be left or right side. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The most important thing in taking zazen posture is to keep your spine straight. Your ears and 
    your shoulders should be on one line. Relax your shoulders, and push up towards the ceiling with
    the back of your with the back of your head. And you should pull your chin in. When your chin is 
    tilted up, you have no strength in your posture; you are probably dreaming. Also to gain strength
    in your posture, press your diaphragm down towards your <i>hara</i>, or lower abdomen. This will
    help you maintain your physical and mental balance. When you try to keep this posture, at first you 
    may find some difficulty breathing naturally, but when you get accustomed to it you will be able 
    to breathe naturally and deeply.
    <p>
    <p>
    Your hands should form the "cosmic mudra." If you put your left hand on top of your right, middle joints
    of your middle fingers together, and touch your thumbs lightly together (as if you held a piece of paper
    between them), your hands will make a beautiful oval. You should keep this universal mudra with great
    care, as if you were holding something very precious in your hand. Your hands should be held against 
    your body, with your thumbs at about the height of your navel. Hold your arms freely and easily  and 
    slightly away from your body, as if you held and egg under each arm without breaking it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your should not be tildted sidways, backwards, or forwards. You should be sitting straight up as if 
    you were supporting the sky with your head. This is not just form or breathing. It expresses the key
    point of Buddhism. It is the perfect expression of your Buddha nature. If you want true understanding
    of Buddhism, you should practice this way. These forms are not a means of obtaining the right state of
    mind. To take this posture itself is athe purpose of the our practice. When you have this posture, you 
    have the right state of mind. When you have this posture, you have the right state of mind, so 
    there is no need to try to attain some special state. When you try to attain something, your mind 
    starts to wander about somewhere else. When you do not try to attain anything, you have your own body and 
    mind right here. A zen master would say, "Kill the Buddha!" Kill the buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere
    else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Doing something is expressing our own nature. We do not exist for the sake of something else. We 
    exist for the sake of ourselves. This is the fundamental teaching expressed in the forms we observe. 
    Just as for sitting, when we stand in the zendo we have some rules. But the purpose of these rules is
    not to make everyone the same, but to allow each to express his own self most freely. For instance, 
    ecah one of us has his own way of standing, so our standing posture is based on the proportions of 
    our bodies. When you stand, your heels should be as far apart as the width of your own fist, 
    your big toes in line with the centers of your breasts. As in zazen, put some strength in your 
    abdomen. Here also hands should express your self. Hold your left hand against your chest with 
    fingers encircling your thumb, and put your right hand over it. Hodling your thumb pointing downward,
    and your forearms parallel ot the floor, you feel as if you have some round pillar in your grasp -- 
    a big round temple pillar-- so you cannot be slumped or tilted to the side. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The most important point is to own your own physical body. If you slump, you will lose yourself. Your 
    mind will be wandering about somewhere else; you will not be in your body. This is not the way. We 
    must exist right here, right now! This is the key point. You must have your own body and mind. Everything
    should exist in the right place, in the right way. Then there is no problem. If the microphone I use
    when I speak exists somewhere else, it will not serve its purpose. When we have our body and mind in 
    order, everything else will exist in the right place, in the right way. 
    </p>

    <p>
    But usually, without being aware of it, we try to change somehting other than ourselves, we try to 
    order things outside us. But it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order.
    When you do things in the right way, at the right time, everything else will be organized. You are
    the "boss." When the boss is sleeping, everyone is sleeping. When the boss does somehting right, 
    everyone will do everything right, and at the right time. That is the secret of Buddhism. 
    </p>

    <p>
    So try always to keep the right posture, not only when you practice zazen, but in all your activities. 
    Take the right posture when you are driving your car, and when you are reading. If you read in slumped 
    position, you cannto stay awake long.  Try. You will discover how importat it is to keep the right posture.
    This is the true teaching. The teaching which is written on paper is not the true teaching. Written teaching
    is kind of food for your brain. Of course it is necessary to take some food for your brain, but it is
    more important to be yourself by practicing the right way of life. 
    </p>

    <p>
    That is why Buddha could not accept the religions existing at his time. He studied many religions, but 
    he was not statisfied with their practices. He could not find the answer in asceticism or in philosophies. 
    He was not interested in some metaphysical existence, but in his own body and mind here and now. And when
    he found himself, he found that everything that exists has Buddha nature. That was his enlightenment. 
    Enlightenmnet is not some good feeling or some particular state of mind. The state of mind that exists when
    you sit in the right posture, itself is enlightenment. If you cannto be satisfied with the state of mind 
    you have i zazen it means your mind is still wandering about. our boand and mind should not be wobbling or 
    wandering about. In this posture there is no need to talk about the right state of mind. You already have it.
    This is the conclusion of Buddhism.
